# Kaggle Projects  

This is a collection of R scripts I wrote to compete in the various data science competitions, primarily on the Kaggle platform.  I first started competing on Kaggle with the Titanic training competition in 2014 and needless to say, my code quality and organization has evolved since then.  I've learned a lot from the R community and by working with larger projects.  Unfortunately, keeping old competition files up to date with my latest habits has proved nearly impossible.  Please keep in mind that these projects show a trajectory of my development 


I've converted a few of these projects into R packages with companion project sites to easily share my work.  Below are the links to the project pages:
